# Notes on "unsafe.unrestricted_volumes":
#
# - The first three mounts are required to make DNS work in the nested
#   container created by BPM for the job to run in.
#
# - The remainder are required to give the job access to the system
#   root certificates so that it actually can verify the certs given
#   to it by its partners (like the router-registrar).
